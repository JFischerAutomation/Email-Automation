The idea behind this project is for a small business, specifically a Banquet Hall.
They have clients that have deposits due upon certain dates, and the owner would like to be notified automatically when the deposits are due without having to reference an excel file or look in their binder.
Thus this simple script reads an Excel "Database" of the deposit information and outputs a GUI with a list of all the people that either A) have an outstanding deposit. Or B) have a deposit due within the next 7 days.
Within the GUI I attached a button that when clicked will automatically email the clients that their deposit is due within a certain date.
This completely removes the need for any sort of mental tracking that the owner would need to do to.
